### Q1 - Fix or improve the implementation of the below methods

```lua
-- I'm not super familiar with lua syntax so I looked up if there's a way to declare constants, hopefully this is right. Declared a constant for 1000 which was used in multiple places so that we can add a name to whatever that 1000 was representing and be able to easily affect all uses of the same constant. Also declared a constant that indicates a released storage value for the same reason
local someStorageID <const> = 1000
local releasedStorageValue <const> = -1;

-- Added storageID parameter so that 1000 is no longer a hard coded value that we'd release. Also to match the addEvent() line which took in some value and player as variables
local function releaseStorage(storageID, player)
    player:setStorageValue(storageID, releasedStorageValue)
end

function onLogout(player)
    -- I'm unsure if getStorageValue is supposed to represent some state or represents some quantity or it can be either of them, but considering I have no other access to any information, I'll assume it's a quantity and a potential logic bug that we'd want to release the storage if we're using it
    if player:getStorageValue(someStorageID) > 0 then
    -- Is the addEvent even neccessary? onLogout I assume would already be called on some callback, could we not release the storage immediately onLogout gets called or would that end up turning into a bug?
        addEvent(releaseStorage, someStorageID, player)
        end
    return true
end
```

### Q2 - Fix or improve the implementation of the below method
```lua
function printSmallGuildNames(memberCount)
    -- this method is supposed to print names of all guilds that have less than memberCount max members

    -- I'm not familiar with database queries, hopefully this syntax still works, but flipped the %d and max_members arguments around because before we were checking if the guild had more than memberCount max members
    local selectGuildQuery = "SELECT name FROM guilds WHERE %d < max_members;"

    -- Removed Id from the variable name as I assume the next line is supposed to be the same variable and using it to get the guild name 
    local result = db.storeQuery(string.format(selectGuildQuery, memberCount))
    local guildName = result.getString("name")
    print(guildName)
end
```

### Q3 - Fix or improve the name and the implementation of the below method
```lua
-- renamed to removeMemberFromParty from do_sth_with_PlayerParty as it seemed to be a more appropriate name
function removeMemberFromParty(playerId, membername)
    player = Player(playerId)
    local party = player:getParty()

    for k,v in pairs(party:getMembers()) do 
        -- created a local variable member as before we were creating a Player multiple times with the same memberName, might as well only create it once and reuse the variable
        local member = Player(membername)
        if v == member then 
            party:removeMember(member)
        end
    end
end
```

### Q4 - Assume all method calls work fine. Fix the memory leak issue in below method

#### Solution 1: Straightforward and naive way
```c++
void Game::addItemToPlayer(const std::string& recipient, uint16_t itemId)
{
    Player* player = g_game.getPlayerByName(recipient);

    //See below for explanation of isLoadedPlayer
    bool isLoadedPlayer = false;
    if (!player) {
        player = new Player(nullptr);
        if (!IOLoginData::loadPlayerByName(player, recipient)) {
            //Memory leak would occur here for player, so added a delete
            delete player;
            return;
        }
        isLoadedPlayer = true;
    }

    //Is this CreateItem() creating a copy on the heap? I'll assume so as I can't see what this create item does
    Item* item = Item::CreateItem(itemId);
    if (!item) {
        //Assuming that the item is a new one on the heap, this would be a memory leak. I'll assume there's a pair function to destroy it onces it's done however
        Item::DestroyItem(item);
        return;
    }

    //Does this internalAddItem take ownership of the Item*? if not then I don't need to destroy it, if it doesn't, then I'd add a line of Item::DestroyItem() after this to make sure we don't get any memory leaks. I'll assume that internalAddItem will either make a copy of the item if it doesn't exists, or based on the FLAG_NOLIMIT, just increment of quantity variable if it
    g_game.internalAddItem(player->getInbox(), item, INDEX_WHEREEVER, FLAG_NOLIMIT);
    Item::DestroyItem(item);

    //I'll assume this savePlayer() doesn't take ownership of player due to g_game.getPlayerByName() would is probably a non-owning reference, while the new Player() line means the player variable is now a owning pointer
    if (player->isOffline()) {
        IOLoginData::savePlayer(player);
    }
    //I assume none of the function calls involving player will take ownership and be responsible for deleting player, and this only occurs if we couldn't getPlayerByName() as we created a new one later down the line
    if(isLoadedPlayer){
        delete player;
    }
}
```

#### Solution 2: Completely my own spin. Please read solution 1 first as it ties some of it's reasoning for me to make this 2nd solution
```c++
void Game::addItemToPlayer(const std::string& recipient, uint16_t itemId)
{
    //Moved the common operation in a lambda as we're probably not going to use this elsewhere, so I kept the code local.
    auto internalAddItemToPlayer = [itemID](Player* player)
    {
        //Turned into a unique_ptr so I won't forget to destroy it in any code paths again.
        std::unique_ptr<Item, void(*)(Item*)> item{ Item::CreateItem(itemId), &Item::DestroyItem };
        if (!item) {
            return;
        }

        g_game.internalAddItem(player->getInbox(), item.get(), INDEX_WHEREEVER, FLAG_NOLIMIT);

        if (player->isOffline()) {
            IOLoginData::savePlayer(player);
        }
    };
    
    //Changed how branching works here to much more easily spot where memory leaks might occur. If we did succeed the getPlayerByName() call, then I know we have a non-owning reference to a player, if not I created a dedicated path with a std::unique_ptr so that we know this path we have a local owning Player* and it's better guarded against memory leaks due to unique_ptr taking care of the delete call for us.
    Player* player = g_game.getPlayerByName(recipient);
    if(player) {
        internalAddItemToPlayer(player);
    }
    else {
        std::unique_ptr<Player> loadedPlayer = std::make_unique<Player>(nullptr);
        if (!IOLoginData::loadPlayerByName(player.get(), recipient)) {
            return;
        }
        internalAddItemToPlayer(player.get());
    }
}
```
